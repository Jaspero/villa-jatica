Perched on the heights above the village of Zaostrog, the villa offers fantastic view of the Adriatic Sea, the tip of Pelješac peninsula, and the islands of Korčula and Hvar. It is a perfect quiet getaway to leave the world behind and truly unwind in wilderness and natural beauty of this remote destination, yet to pamper yourself in complete comfort and luxury the house offers.</p>

            <p class="font-secondary m-y-s">If you feel like sightseeing, you can choose from a number of exciting places whether you decide to drive up north towards the town of Split or down south towards the town of Dubrovnik. If you choose to visit Split, you will pass through beautiful small coastal places, as well as the town of Makarska and Omiš, both well worth of sightseeing. Also, you can visit the sunniest island of Hvar since ferry port Drvenik is merely several minutes drive from Zaostrog.</p>
