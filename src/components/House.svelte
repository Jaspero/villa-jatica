        <p class="font-secondary m-y-s p-a-m w-full ta-left">With its spectacular views of the sea and islands, the mountain and blue Mediterranean skies, this newly renovated house is a combination of traditional Dalmatian architecture and modern interventions, built with respect for and appreciation of the tradition, thus resulting in a new construction having that charming old Dalmatian feel. The exterior stones in warm light beige tone and blue window shutters are in complete harmony with the blue sea, rocky mountain and the surrounding Mediterranean vegetation.</p>
